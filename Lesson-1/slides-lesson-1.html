						<h3>Differences between traditional programming and ML</h3>

					<section>
						<p align="justify">A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to
						a certain class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at
						that class of tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
						Usually P is specific to the class of tasks T being carried out by the system.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p align="justify">ML algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data. This
							circumstance enables the algorithm to solve tasks that are too difficult to solve with
							fixed programs written and designed by humans.</p>

						<h3>Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning</h3>
						<p align="justify">Based on the way the learning process in an ML algorithm is devised, they can be
						categorised as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
						<p align="justify">It is characterised by a function f(x) that maps the input data x to
							the desired output data Y.</p>
						<p align="justify">It is called ‘supervised’ because the values of x and Y are known (i.e. the data are
							labelled).</p>
						<p align="justify">During the algorithm learning process, the predictions done on the
							training data are corrected using the Y values. The objective of a supervised learning
							algorithm is to find the mapping function f that achieves acceptable levels of
							performance based on the user needs.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
						<p align="justify">Unsupervised learning is a type of ML that looks for previously 
							undetected patterns in a dataset with no pre-existing
							labels and with a minimum of human supervision. </p>

						<p align="justify">In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human labelled data, unsupervised
							learning allows for modelling of probability densities over inputs. The objective here is to 
							present the most interesting structure that best describes the input data.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
						<p align="justify">RL is concerned with how a software agent can find the best actions to take in an
						environment in order to maximise the notion of cumulative reward. The agent passes
						from one state (S) to another (S') by choosing actions (A), these actions produce
						positive or negative changes in the environment, which are reported to the agent as
						rewards (R).</p>

					<h2>Dataset</h2>
					<p>Typically a dataset is divided into three parts</p>
					<div class="r-hstack justify-center">
						<div data-id="box1" style="background: #999; width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"></div>
						<div data-id="box2" style="background: #999; width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"></div>
						<div data-id="box3" style="background: #999; width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"></div>

					<p data-auto-animate-delay="0.8" align="justify">During the training the model is trained and evaluated
						with the <a style="color: cyan">training</a> and <a style="color: magenta">validation</a>  dataset.

					<h2>Choice and use of a dataset</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p align="justify">Heterogeneity of the data:</p>
					<p align="justify">Many ML/DL algorithms require require the input features to be numerical and
						scaled to similar ranges</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p align="justify">Redundancy in the data:</p>
					<p align="justify">If the input features contain redundant information, some learning algorithms, 
							will perform poorly because of numerical instabilities.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p align="justify">Presence of interactions and non-linearities:</p>
					<p align="justify">If each of the features makes an independent contribution to the output, 
						then algorithms based on linear functions (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, 
						support vector machines, naive Bayes) and distance functions (e.g. nearest neighbour methods,
						support vector machines with Gaussian kernels) generally perform well. However, if there are
						complex interactions among features, then algorithms such as decision trees
						and neural networks work better, because they are specifically designed to discover
						these interactions.</p>
