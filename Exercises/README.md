This module contains four exercies:

1. [Machine Learning Based Multiclass Classification](EuroSAT_ML_Classification.ipynb)
2. [Deep Learning Based Multiclass Classification](EuroSAT_CNN_Classification.ipynb)
3. [Deep Learning Based Autoencoer](EuroSAT_CNN_Autoencoder.ipynb)
4. [Deep/Machine Learning Based Clustering](EuroSAT_CNN_Autoencoder_Clustering.ipynb)
5. [Deep Learning Based Super Resolution](EuroSAT_CNN_SuperResolution.ipynb)

**Plese note that these are exercises designed to introduce students to ML and DL**
